## Evaluate performance of simple ESN model on lorenz and 2sin dataset

### Purpose of the project
- Implement a standard echo state network (ESN) model without including feedback from the output and the leaky-integrator neurons.  
- Perform experiments and comment the results by considering a _k_ step ahead forecasting task on the "2sine" and "lorentz" time series data. 
- Evaluate the impact of different relevant hyper-parameters.
- Lastly, evaluate the model on different k
